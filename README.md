## Aknowledgements

I am very grateful to Krayfer, who helped me updating the content of the app (i.e. formulas, plots etc.), while I was working on the design and java code. Also, I would like to express my gratitude to the <a href="https://www.freepik.com/" target="_blank">`Freepik`</a>, who created the icons and allowed its free usage.
